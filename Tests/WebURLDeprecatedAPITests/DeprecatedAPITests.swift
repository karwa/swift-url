// There is a separate test target for deprecated APIs, so we can test them
// without adding a bunch of compile-time warnings to the regular test target.
// Even if blank, it is useful to keep this file for history purposes,
// so the test target and its folder don't keep being created and deleted all the time.

// Currently, there are no deprecated APIs.
