extension WebURL {

  /// A read-write view of this URL with the same API as JavaScript's `URL` class.
  ///
  /// This view matches the API of JavaScript's `URL` class as defined by the [WHATWG URL Standard][whatwg-url-class],
  /// and is validated using the `web-platform-tests` suite of cross-browser tests. It is designed to support
  /// developers porting applications from JavaScript, or who have cross JavaScript-Swift codebases.
  ///
  /// We recommend that developers who do not have a strong need for JavaScript's exact API stick to using
  /// `WebURL`'s component properties directly rather than through this view. The differences between `WebURL`
  /// and JavaScript are minimal: a slightly more ergonomic value returned for some components,
  /// and some more predictable edge-case behavior. These differences are documented below.
  ///
  /// This view allows modifying the URL's components, making it simple to isolate areas where the JavaScript
  /// API is required.
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// // This demonstrates filtering of tabs and newlines,
  /// // which is something JS does but WebURL normally does not do.
  /// var url = WebURL("https://example.com/foo")!
  /// url.jsModel.search = "\t\thello\n"
  /// url.fragment
  /// // âœ… "hello"
  ///
  /// // You can use the JSModel for multiple operations and
  /// // return to the WebURL model when finished.
  /// var jsURL = url.jsModel
  /// // ...(some operations)
  /// return jsURL.swiftModel
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Differences Between WebURL and JavaScript
  ///
  /// This view behaves like JavaScript in all of the described situations. When we mention WebURL's behavior,
  /// we are referring to the component properties available directly on the `WebURL` type (not through this view).
  ///
  /// Note that the JavaScript property named "protocol" is named "scheme" in this view,
  /// as it can be awkward to work with a property named "protocol" in Swift.
  ///
  /// ### More Noticeable
  ///
  /// 1. `WebURL` components do not include delimiters.
  ///
  ///    Considering the URL `"http://example.com?foo#bar"`, the components returned by each API would be:
  ///
  ///    | JS Name    | Example | WebURL Name | Example |
  ///    | ---------- | ------- | ----------- | ------- |
  ///    | `protocol` | `http:` | `scheme`    | `http`  |
  ///    | `search`   | `?foo`  | `query`     | `foo`   |
  ///    | `hash`     | `#bar`  | `fragment`  | `bar`   |
  ///
  ///    This difference only applies to the above 3 components; both models do not include delimiters for
  ///    other components. Most consumers of these values are going to immediately drop the delimiter anyway,
  ///    so WebURL just does it for you. Additionally, it matches the behavior of Foundation's `URL` type,
  ///    which makes transitioning code to WebURL a little bit easier.
  ///
  /// ### Adjustments to Edge-Cases
  ///
  /// 1. `WebURL` uses `nil` to signal that a value is not present, rather than an empty string.
  ///
  ///    This is a more accurate description of components which keep their delimiter even when empty.
  ///    For example, consider the following URLs:
  ///
  ///    - `http://example.com/`
  ///    - `http://example.com/?`
  ///
  ///    According to the URL Standard, these URLs are different; however, JavaScript's `search` property returns
  ///    an empty string for both. In fact, these URLs return identical values for _every_ component in JS,
  ///    and yet still the overall URLs compare as not equal to each other. This has some subtle secondary effects,
  ///    such as `url.search = url.search` potentially changing the URL.
  ///
  ///    `WebURL` avoids this by saying that the first URL has a `nil` query (to mean "not present"),
  ///    and the latter has an empty query. This has the nice property that every unique URL has
  ///    a unique combination of URL components.
  ///
  /// 2. `WebURL` does not filter ASCII whitespace characters in component setters.
  ///
  ///    In JavaScript, tabs and newlines are silently filtered when setting a URL component:
  ///
  ///    ```js
  ///    // JavaScript
  ///    url.search = "\t\thello\n";
  ///    url.search; // "hello"
  ///    ```
  ///
  ///    `WebURL` does not; instead, these characters will be percent-encoded as other disallowed characters are.
  ///    URLs are complex enough; why add things?
  ///
  /// 3. `WebURL` does not ignore trailing content when setting a component.
  ///
  ///    Many properties in the JavaScript model do this. It's totally weird, and surely nobody will miss it.
  ///
  ///    ```js
  ///    // JavaScript
  ///    var url      = new URL("https://example.com/");
  ///    url.protocol = "ftp://foobar.org/";
  ///    url.href;
  ///    // "ftp://example.com"
  ///    //  ^^^
  ///    ```
  ///
  ///    This operation would fail with WebURL, because `"ftp://foobar.org/"` is not a valid scheme.
