/// A description of a file path's structure.
///
/// A format describes the structure and normalization rules of a file path, as well as the
/// properties of binary paths supported by WebURL. They are used to interpret or prepare file paths
/// for a particular system.
///
/// ```swift
/// // ℹ️ POSIX paths (for macOS, iOS, Linux, etc) require the .posix format.
/// try WebURL(filePath: "/usr/bin/swift", format: .posix)
///   // ✅ "file:///usr/bin/swift"
/// try WebURL(filePath: "/usr/bin/swift", format: .windows)
///   // ❌ Not a valid Windows path (no drive letter).
///
/// // ℹ️ Windows paths require the .windows format.
/// try WebURL(filePath: #"C:\Windows\"#, format: .windows)
///   // ✅ "file:///C:/Windows/"
/// try WebURL(filePath: #"C:\Windows\"#, format: .posix)
///   // ❌ Interpreted as a relative path by POSIX (no "/").
///
/// // ℹ️ Use .native for the current machine's format (.native is usually the default).
/// try WebURL(filePath: NSTemporaryDirectory(), format: .native)
///   // ✅ A known native path.
/// ```
///
/// Currently, two file path formats are supported: ``posix`` and ``windows``. Their documentation provides
/// detailed information and references about the kinds of paths which are supported, and how to interoperate
/// with the platform's binary path format.
///
/// Most of the time you should specify the ``native`` format, which resolves to the appropriate value
/// for the compile target.
///
/// > Tip:
/// > If you're only working with paths for the local system, we recommend using swift-system's `FilePath` type.
/// > The `WebURLSystemExtras` module contains WebURL <-> FilePath conversions which handle the details of each
/// > system's path format for you, and help you write portable, correct code.
/// >
/// > ```swift
/// > // This works on both POSIX systems and Windows
/// > // (although the file locations need adapting).
/// > import WebURL
/// > import System
/// > import WebURLSystemExtras
/// >
/// > // Start with a file URL.
/// > let url = WebURL("file:///private/tmp/my%20file.dat")!
/// >
/// > // Reconstruct the file path.
/// > let path = try FilePath(url: url)

  ///
  /// Consecutive separators can be normalized to a single separator, except that 2 separators at the start
  /// of the path cannot be collapsed. This means that:

  /// - `/usr/bin`,
  /// - `/usr//bin`, and
  /// - `/usr///bin`
  ///
  /// Are all the same path, but `//usr/bin` is considered a different path.
  ///
  /// As the contents of path components have no defined meaning, they must not be altered by any normalization
  /// procedure.
  ///
  /// ## Binary Path Encoding
  ///
  /// This section describes how binary file paths are obtained from the Operating System and how their bytes
  /// are interpreted by WebURL functions.
  ///
  /// The following byte values have particular meaning in POSIX-style paths.
  ///
  /// | Code Unit       | ASCII Character | Purpose                                       |

  /// | `0x00`          |       -         | End of String                                 |
  /// | `0x2E`          |      `.`        | Current directory (1x); Parent directory (2x) |
  /// | `0x2F`          |      `/`        | Path separator                                |
  ///
  /// All other values are not specified and do not necessarily have any meaning beyond opaque bytes.

  ///

  /// ## Path Formats & Normalization
  ///
  /// There are many, many Windows path formats. This format value represents the most common ones:
  /// DOS paths, UNC paths, and Long paths.
  ///
  /// | Kind           | Example                                               |
  /// |----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
  /// | DOS path       | `C:\Users\Alice\Desktop\family.jpg`                   |
  /// | UNC path       | `\\us-west.example.com\files\meeting-notes-june.docx` |
  /// | Long DOS path  | `\\?\C:\Users\Bob\Documents\...`                      |
  /// | Long UNC path  | `\\?\UNC\europe.example.com\jim\...`                  |
  ///
  /// Each of these has different sets of allowed characters and normalization rules, which are summarized
  /// in subsequent sections. This information has been collected from a variety of sources which may be worth
  /// consulting for further clarification:
  ///
  /// - [Microsoft: File path formats on Windows systems][MS-PathFormat]
  /// - [Microsoft: Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces][MS-FileNaming]
  /// - [Microsoft: UNC Path specification][MS-UNCSPEC]
  /// - [Project Zero: The Definitive Guide on Win32 to NT Path Conversion][PRZ-NTPaths]
  ///
  /// ### DOS Paths
  ///
  /// DOS paths begin with a drive letter and path separator.
  /// Both forward-slashes and back-slashes are accepted as path separators.
  ///
  /// Windows has a notion of a "current drive", and each drive has its own "current directory".
  /// This means there are lots of kinds of relative paths:
  ///
  /// | Path                         | Description                                              |
  /// | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
  /// | `C:\Users\Alice\picture.jpg` | A path from the root of the `C:` drive (fully-qualified) |
  /// | `\Users\Alice\picture.jpg`   | A path from the root of the current drive                |
  /// | `D:picture.jpg`              | A path from the current directory of the `D:` drive      |
  /// | `picture.jpg`                | A path from the current directory of the current drive   |
  ///
  /// ### UNC Paths
  ///
  /// UNC paths begin with a two-separator prefix, followed by a server name, share name, and a path within the share.
  /// Both forward-slashes and back-slashes are accepted as path separators.
  ///
  /// **Example**: `\\us-west.example.com\files\meeting-notes-june.docx`
  /// - **Server**: `us-west.example.com`
  /// - **Share**: `files`
  /// - **Path**: `\meeting-notes-june.docx`
  ///
  /// UNC paths are always fully-qualified. It is possible to resolve relative references against them,
  /// but there is no concept of a "relative UNC path".
  ///
  /// For both DOS and UNC paths, consecutive separators can be normalized to a single separator (except for the
  /// double-slash prefix in UNC paths).
  ///
  /// Trailing ASCII periods and spaces may be trimmed from path components, in accordance with
  /// [Microsoft's documentation][MS-PathFormat]. It is not possible to express files named "`foo.`"
  /// with these paths, and even trying can be dangerous.
  ///
  /// ### Long paths
  ///
  /// Regular Windows paths are typically limited to 260 characters; in order to overcome this limit, an alternative
  /// "long path" format can be used. These have the prefix "`\\?\`", and are a kind of low-level path handled by
  /// something called the "object manager". They can point to devices and more abstract things, but also support
  /// locations with drive letters and UNC locations.
  ///
  /// | Path                                              | Description                      |
  /// | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
  /// | `\\?\C:\Users\Alice\...`                          | Long file path with drive letter |
  /// | `\\?\UNC\us-west.example.com\files\...`           | Long UNC path                    |
  /// | `\\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1` | Abstract Win32 path              |
  ///
  /// The strict definition of these paths is that the back-slash (`\`, `0x5C`) is the path separator,
  /// and **all other characters** (even `NULL`s) are unreserved and may be used in path components.
  ///
  /// This has some interesting implications, and forces us to accept the following limitations:
  ///
  /// - "`..`" components are forbidden.
  ///
  ///   In this case, they do not mean parent traversal, but actually a file _named_ "`..`". This cannot be expressed
  ///   in a URL (even with percent-encoding). Also, Windows APIs are not consistent, and will sometimes interpret
  ///   these as parent traversal regardless, and this ambiguity could be a potential security risk.
  ///   No commonly-used filesystem or network protocol on Windows supports these file or directory names anyway.
  ///
  /// - Forward slashes are forbidden.
  ///
  ///   They represent files with literal forward slashes in their name. Again, Windows APIs are not consistent,
  ///   and will sometimes interpret these as path separators regardless, which can be a security risk.
  ///   No commonly-used filesystem or network protocol on Windows supports these file or directory names anyway.
  ///
  /// In practice, they should not affect well-formed long paths. Additionally, this `FilePathFormat` limits the allowed
  /// Win32 paths to those which are actually "long file paths":
  ///
  /// - Long file paths with drive letters
  /// - Long UNC paths
  ///
  /// Paths such as `\\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\...` are not supported. Due to this limiting accepted paths to those used
  /// in filesystem contexts, the following normalization procedure is considered safe:
  ///
  /// - Empty and "`.`" components will be removed.
  ///
  ///   Empty components have no meaning on any filesystem, and all commonly-used filesystems on Windows
  ///   (including FAT, exFAT, NTFS, and ReFS) forbid files and directories named "`.`". SMB/CIFS and NFS
  ///   (the most common protocols used with UNC) likewise define that "`.`" components refer to the current directory.
  ///
  /// ## Binary Path Encoding
  ///
  /// This section describes how binary file paths are obtained from the Operating System and how their bytes
  /// are interpreted by WebURL functions.
  ///
  /// Windows file paths are defined as containing Unicode code-points. However, Windows for the most part
  /// does not verify that Unicode text is valid, nor does it employ canonical equivalence for path lookups.
  /// This means that path components may contain invalid text (such as lone surrogates), and their code-points
  /// must be preserved exactly. Reserved code-points are within the ASCII range.
  ///
  /// | Code-Point(s)            | Character(s) | Purpose                                        |
  /// | ------------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
  /// | REVERSE SOLIDUS, U+005C  |    `\`       | Path separator                                 |
  /// | SOLIDUS, U+002F          |    `/`       | Path separator (DOS and UNC only)              |
  /// | FULL STOP, U+002E        |    `.`       | Current directory (1x); Parent directory (2x)  |
  /// | QUESTION MARK, U+003F    |    `?`       | Element of Long Path prefix ("`\\?\`")         |
  /// | Alphas from Basic Latin  | `a-z,A-Z`    | Drive letters (DOS and Long DOS only)          |
  /// | COLON, U+003A            |    `:`       | Drive-letter delimiter (DOS and Long DOS only) |
  ///
  /// As such, this format defines an 8-bit binary file path to be in an **unspecified, ASCII-compatible encoding**.
  /// Effectively, ASCII bytes will be considered as alphas, colons, slashes, spaces, etc., and all other bytes
  /// within a path component are considered opaque. There is one exception: the hostname of a UNC or Long UNC path
  /// must be valid UTF-8/ASCII, as it is subject to domain normalization (IDNA).
  ///
  /// The Windows API exposes file paths using UTF-16 code-units, which can be transcoded to/from UTF-8 losslessly.
  /// This is the preferred process, as UTF-8 supports all Unicode code-points and is expected by other systems.
  /// Handling invalid Unicode is, unfortunately, left as an exercise for the reader.
  /// There have been some creative solutions to this problem, such as the pseudo-encoding ["WTF-8"][WTF-8]
  /// (the "Wobbly Transformation Format"), which encodes these code-points in UTF-8 style regardless.
  /// It is admittedly a hack, but it can be useful in isolated systems.
  /// If in doubt, throw a ``URLFromFilePathError/transcodingFailure``.
  ///
  /// The definition of "unspecified, ASCII-compatible encoding" also happens to include ANSI encodings,
  /// such as Latin-1 or Windows-31J. It may be necessary to produce such URLs when interoperating
  /// with legacy systems, but their use is discouraged in favor of Unicode.

  /// The TL;DR is:

// MARK: - File path from URL
// --------------------------------------------


extension WebURL {

  /// Reconstructs a binary file path from a URL.
  ///
  /// In order to create a file path, the URL must satisfy two conditions:
  ///
  /// - It must be a file URL, containing a semantically valid, non-relative path according to the ``FilePathFormat``.
  /// - It must not contain any percent-encoded directory separators or NULL bytes.
  ///
  /// Otherwise, a ``FilePathFromURLError`` error will be thrown which can be used to provide diagnostics.
  ///
  /// Some minimal normalization is applied to the path according to the ``FilePathFormat`` (for example,
  /// collapsing duplicate slashes, such as `/usr//bin` -> `/usr/bin`), and percent-encoding is removed.
  ///
  /// ### Encoding
  ///
  /// Binary paths consist of bytes decoded from the URL. Depending on the platform's file path encoding,
  /// some interpretation may be necessary.
  ///
  /// - On POSIX (Apple, Linux, etc) systems, the returned path may be used directly (without transcoding).
  ///   Request a null-terminated binary file path, then use the array's pointer as a C string when interacting
  ///   with the operating system.
  ///
  /// - On Windows, we need to turn the bytes in to a set of Unicode code-points, in UTF-16 encoding.
  ///
  ///   To do that, we need to guess how these bytes we received from some URL might be encoded.
  ///   A good strategy is to first try transcoding from UTF-8 since it is self-validating and widely used,
  ///   and if that fails, fall back to trying ANSI code-pages, including the system-specific "active" code-page.
  ///   The platform's `MultiByteToWideChar` function is able to map these encodings to Unicode.
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// // This example demonstrates use on POSIX systems;
  /// // Windows developers should convert to UTF-16 and use the '-W' family of platform functions.
  /// // Or use swift-system's FilePath.
  /// import Darwin // or Glibc, etc.
  /// let openFn: (UnsafePointer<CChar>, Int32, mode_t) -> Int32 = Darwin.open
  ///
  /// // Start with a file URL.
  /// let url = WebURL("file:///private/tmp/my%20file.dat")!
  ///
  /// // Reconstruct the binary file path.
  /// let binaryPath = try WebURL.binaryFilePath(from: url, nullTerminated: true)
  ///
  /// // Handle signed CChar by rebinding.
  /// binaryPath.withUnsafeBufferPointer {
  ///   $0.withMemoryRebound(to: CChar.self) { cString in
  ///     // Use the C string to interact with the OS.
  ///     let descriptor = openFn(cString.baseAddress!, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IROTH)
  ///     // ... write to file
  ///     close(descriptor)
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// > Tip:
  /// > To work with binary file paths, we recommend developers use a dedicated file path type,
  /// > such as swift-system's `FilePath`. The `FilePath(url: WebURL)` initializer from `WebURLSystemExtras` is
  /// > the best way to construct a file path from a URL. It automatically handles platform-specific details
