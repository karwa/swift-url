  /// }

  /// The scheme of this URL, for example `https` or `file`.

  /// A URL‚Äôs `scheme` is a non-empty, lowercased ASCII string that identifies the type of URL and can be used to

  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// WebURL("https://example.com/")!.scheme     // "https"
  /// WebURL("file:///usr/bin/swift")!.scheme    // "file"
  /// WebURL("my.app:/profile/settings")!.scheme // "my.app"
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Examples of URL schemes [include][wiki-schemes] `bitcoin`, `data`, `fax` (!), `rdar`, `redis`, and `spotify`.
  /// URL components, such as the ``hostname`` and ``path``, can mean quite different things in each of these schemes.
  ///
  /// Some schemes (known as _"special"_ schemes) are known to the URL Standard:
  ///
  /// - `http`, and `https`,
  /// - `ws`, and `wss`
  /// - `ftp`,
  /// - `file`
  ///
  /// URLs with these schemes may use different validation or normalization logic than other URLs.
  /// For example, they may be required to have a hostname, or to have a non-empty path,
  /// and that is checked at the URL level.
  ///
  /// The following example demonstrates setting a URL's scheme, as part of a function which upgrades
  /// insecure HTTP and WebSocket requests to use encryption.
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// func ensureSecure(_ url: WebURL) -> WebURL? {
  ///   switch url.scheme {
  ///   case "https", "wss":
  ///     return url
  ///   case "http", "ws":
  ///     var secureURL = url
  ///     secureURL.scheme += "s"
