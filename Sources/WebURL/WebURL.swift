// Javascript-y object model.

/// The `WebURL` interface is used to parse, construct, normalize, and encode URLs.
///
/// It works by providing properties which allow you to easily read and modify the components of a URL.
/// You normally create a new URL object by specifying the URL as a string when calling its initializer,
/// or by providing a relative URL and a base URL.
/// You can then easily read the parsed components of the URL or make changes to the URL.
///
/// The parser and API are designed according to the WHATWG specification (https://url.spec.whatwg.org/)
/// as it was on 14.06.2020. Therefore, it should match the expectations of web developers and more accurately reflect
/// the kinds of URLs a browser will accept or reject.
