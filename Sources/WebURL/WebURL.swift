  /// if a URL has an opaque path.
  ///
  /// ### List-style Paths
  ///
  /// List-style paths contain a number of hierarchical components delimited by the "`/`" character,
  /// and are by far the most common style of paths. If a URL has a host (including an empty host),
  /// or its path begins with a "`/`", it has a list-style path. URLs with a special ``scheme``
  /// (such as http, https, or file URLs) _always_ have list-style paths.
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// var url = WebURL("https://github.com/karwa/swift-url")!
  /// url.path                   // "/karwa/swift-url"
  /// url.path = "/apple/swift"  // ‚úÖ "https://github.com/apple/swift"
  ///
  /// // ‚ÑπÔ∏è List-style paths are automatically normalized.
  /// url.path = "/apple/swift/../../whatwg/url"  // "https://github.com/whatwg/url"
  /// ```
  ///
  /// When constructing list-style path strings using data obtained at runtime, be mindful that paths
  /// are lists of percent-encoded components, **not** percent-encoded lists of components. Each component must
  /// be encoded/decoded individually to guarantee that the path has the correct structure.
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// func urlForBand(_ name: String) -> WebURL {
  ///   var url  = WebURL("https://example.com/")!
  ///   url.path = "/music/bands/" + name.percentEncoded(using: .urlComponentSet)
  ///   return url
  /// }
  /// urlForBand("The Rolling Stones")
  /// // ‚úÖ "https://example.com/music/bands/The%20Rolling%20Stones"
  /// urlForBand("AC/DC")
  /// // ‚úÖ "https://example.com/music/bands/AC%2FDC"
  /// ```
  ///
  /// > Tip:
  /// > Correctly handling list-style paths in string form is non-trivial, which is why `WebURL` includes
  /// > a ``pathComponents-swift.property`` write-through view to read and modify these kinds of paths.
  ///
  /// ### Opaque Paths
  ///
  /// If a URL has no host and its path does not begin with a "`/`", that path is considered by the URL Standard to
  /// be an opaque string. Since they are opaque, these paths have no assumed hierarchical structure, and are
  /// incompatible with the ``pathComponents-swift.property`` view. Modifying a URL's opaque path is unsupported
  /// and will fail.
  ///
  /// These URLs tend to be quite rare. See the ``hasOpaquePath`` property for more information about them.
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// var url = WebURL("mailto:bob@example.com")!
  /// url.path           // "bob@example.com"
  /// url.hasOpaquePath  // true
  ///
  /// // ‚ùå Modifying opaque paths is unsupported.
  /// url.path = "monica@example.com" // "bob@example.com" (Unchanged)
  /// ```
  ///
